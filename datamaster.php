              <td>Limousin cattle are the most sought after beef cattle in Indonesia. This species includes cows because of the picture in the cave of French ancestors. Limousin cattle habitat is in a very cold area. Growing grass does not flourish there Although the habitat is recovered, Limousin cattle escape natural selection which makes them develop into beef cattle with quality meat. But good quality beef. Limousin is not merely about natural selection. Breeders in France struggle to maintain the quality of these cows to produce superior meat.</td>

They haven't remained trapped on French soil however, as over 70 different countries are now home to the breed. As a continental type of cattle, they're well suited to a variety of climates and are well-adapted for Ireland's temperate weather, with the ability to thrive through damp winters and the odd hot spell in summer.</td>

Its strong physique attracts the attention of American cattle breeders to breed Brahma cows. Thanks to adequate technology in America, Brahma cows have been bred into cows with quality meat and unreasonable weights. Brahma cows can be imported from America and are now known as phenomenal beef cattle.</td>

From this crossing, a large Beefalo cow was created. Beefalo cattle are said to have lower fat, low bad cholesterol, and high protein than cattle in general. In addition, Beefalo cattle also have very thick skin down the skin of bison so they can adapt to extreme cold weather.</td>
